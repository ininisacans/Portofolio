            Hello! I&apos;m Nisa, a 7th-semester student majoring in Software Engineering at Politeknik Negeri Banyuwangi. 
            Throughout my academic journey, I&apos;ve been actively involved in various software development projects that focus 
            on collaboration and real-world application.
          </p>

          <p className="mt-4 text-justify text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
            Thanks to the Project-Based Learning approach in my program, I&apos;ve gained hands-on experience working in teams 
            to build tangible software products. These projects have shaped my technical abilities and also strengthened 
            my communication, teamwork, and problem-solving skills.
          </p>

          <p className="mt-4 text-justify text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
            I&apos;ve worked with programming languages such as PHP, JavaScript, and Java, and I have a solid foundation in 
            database management using MySQL and MariaDB. For web development, I frequently use the Laravel framework 
            because of its structure and scalability.
          </p>

          <p className="mt-4 text-justify text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
            In the 6th semester, I joined the Studi Independen Bersertifikat (SIB) program by Dicoding, supported by the DBS 
            Foundation as part of Kampus Merdeka. I chose the Full Stack Developer path, where I learned about web 
            fundamentals, RESTful APIs, clean code practices, and deploymentâ€”all through real-world project experience. 
            It was a valuable journey that enhanced my self-discipline and technical depth.
          </p>

          <p className="mt-4 text-justify text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
            Currently, I&apos;m doing an Industrial Internship at PT Taksu Teknologi Indonesia, where I&apos;m gaining direct exposure 
            to real tech industry practices. This experience has helped me apply what I&apos;ve learned in a professional setting, 
            while also preparing me to grow as a future web developer.
